Claude models are discovered from the installed binary instead of a shipped list (#338, #340).

The claude adapter gains a live `models()`: the prompt-free `initialize` handshake of the installed `claude` binary (one stdin frame, exit on EOF, never `--model`, `--setting-sources ""`, `--strict-mcp-config`, model-override env scrubbed) answers the picker's selectors with their vendor-reported resolutions; the rows travel as `origin: live` with `resolved_model`, followed by the frozen `CLAUDE_KNOWN_MODELS` ids as `origin: hint` so presence never shrinks below the manifest. A `config_dir_login` profile is probed under its own config dir and keychain bridge, an `api_key`/`oauth_token` profile with its own credential in the env var its runs use under a scratch HOME (the account's own rows in `?view=accounts`, cache keyed by profile id, never by a secret); the unscoped listing is a credential-free binary probe under a scratch HOME with non-essential traffic off. The answer is total: a missing or failing binary yields the hint rows and the registry reports `source: manifest` with the frozen `verifiedAgainst` stamp rather than a live claim. One cached single-flight capture per (scope, binary identity) lives an hour (a minute for failures); `harnessBinaryIdentity` in core keys it and the `--help` effort memo by realpath, inode, size and mtime, so an in-place CLI update is re-read without a daemon restart; a run whose env patch carries a PATH has its effort ladder, readonly flag set and `--version` read from the binary that PATH selects. The manifest declares `model_inventory_absence: "advisory"` and freezes `known_models_verified_against` at the literal 2.1.261. `HarnessModel` gains optional `origin` and `resolved_model` (absent = live; producers that predate the field need no change); `claudexor models` prints resolutions and hint marks.

Invariants: INV-104 governs the declaration (amended in the sibling commit); INV-020/INV-022 hold (both new fields have a producer and readers).
