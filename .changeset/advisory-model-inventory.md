A Codex model list that omits a model no longer refuses a run that asks for it.

The vendor CLI fetches its model list remotely and falls back to a bundled default list when that fetch times out, and nothing on the wire says which list answered. Claudexor treated the answer as account truth, so an explicit model the list lacked was refused before dispatch, in under a second, as an untyped failure. Observed live: `gpt-6-astra` was refused 32 times over two days on thirteen accounts that ran it successfully 262 times in the same window, and an empty answer refused the same way.

A harness now declares what its live inventory proves. The new optional manifest capability `model_inventory_absence` defaults to `authoritative`, which is today's strict behaviour for every harness; Codex declares `advisory`, because its list can prove a model is present but never that one is absent. On an advisory source a missing (or empty) list stops being a refusal: the explicit model is forwarded to the vendor exactly as asked, the vendor accepts or refuses it, and the per-spawn gate discloses once, in the run's events, that the model was not listed. The same decision now serves the explicit reviewer panel, so an owner-chosen reviewer model is no longer refused by a stale list either.

Nothing else moved. Manifest truth stays strict and is never substituted to admit a model, settings writes and the doctor's configured-model check still read the manifest and still refuse, automatic reviewer selection still skips an unlisted family at zero cost, authenticated account catalog operations still return a typed `model_unavailable`, pinned accounts still never rotate, and the probe cache and its TTL are unchanged.

Two consequences are worth stating plainly. A vendor CLI that refuses a forwarded model reports it as an ordinary error carrying the vendor's own text, not as a typed model failure (only the HTTP model operations are typed, and those stay strict). And a mistyped model name on such a harness now costs one spawn at the vendor instead of failing for free at the gate.

Invariants: INV-104 is amended with the owner's explicit approval of 2026-09-21 — strict wherever the truth source can prove absence, forward and disclose where it cannot, and never substitute one list for another. INV-105 follows from it: an explicit model can now reach a route its truth source could not vouch for, and the run discloses that instead of staying silent. INV-020 (schema first, regenerate, then consumers) and INV-022 (a field ships with its producer and consumer) hold: the capability is declared by the Codex manifest and read by the model gate and the reviewer panel in this change. The app compatibility floor is unchanged.
