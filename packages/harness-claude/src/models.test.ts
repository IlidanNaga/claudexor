/**
 * Manifest model-truth pinning (INV-104): `known_models` is the frozen hint
 * list the manifest advertises, judged under the harness's own absence
 * declaration (Claude declares `advisory`: a foreign id is forwarded with a
 * note, never refused up front). These tests pin the CURRENT catalog entries
 * end to end: the manifest advertises the id, the stamp names the exact
 * installed CLI the list was verified against, and the truth owner
 * (`validateModel`) accepts the id round-trip and judges a foreign one by the
 * declaration. A model added to the vendor catalog but missing here is the
 * PR #54 defect shape: the newest Opus was unpinnable while the bare `opus`
 * alias silently floated.
