/**
 * Lifetime of the shared `claude --help` capture.
 *
 * The parse is covered in `effort.test.ts`; what is proven here is who OWNS the
 * one capture the whole process shares. A long-lived `claudexord` outlives every
 * individual run, so a memo that records a cancelled run's kill, or a moment when
 * the binary could not be spawned, keeps serving that non-answer forever — and
 * the effort ladder's fallback is a snapshot from ONE CLI version, so the
 * consequence is not staleness but `xhigh` forwarded to a binary that rejects it.
 *
 * These tests drive the real spawn against a stub `claude` on disk, because the
 * hazard lives in the interaction between the memo and the process, not in either
 * one alone.
