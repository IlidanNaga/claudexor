  // only be readonly|workspace_write and the full-access grant is a separate
  // explicit field; a hand-edited user-level trust file may itself carry
  // `access_default: full`, which still faces this gate on a non-delegated run.

  // A run marked `execution.delegated` skips it: an external orchestrator owns
  // the workspace and carries its own authority. What that buys differs by
  // caller, so state both honestly. A control-API client holds the daemon token
  // and can already POST /v2/trust to grant itself the allow, so the second
  // ceremony bought nothing there. An MCP tool caller is the HOST'S MODEL: it
  // holds no token and has no trust-writing tool, so for it this marker is a
  // real widening — one call with `delegated: true` and `access: "full"` runs
  // unsandboxed native full on any `repoPath` with no grant, and the only
  // remaining control is the host's own MCP tool-approval policy. Kept anyway
  // per INV-122: prefer the broad capability plus an accurate residual over a
  // weaker second boundary. The residual is disclosed in SECURITY.md.
