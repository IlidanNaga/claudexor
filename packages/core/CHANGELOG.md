## 3.12.10

### Patch Changes

- A run's failure record carries the vendor's own failure code beside its words.

  When a Codex turn fails, `codex exec --json` delivers only the vendor's sentence, while Codex's own rollout record of the same thread keeps a machine-readable code (a capacity refusal is `server_overloaded`). Claudexor labelled such a run a process crash, advised that the harness process crashed, and reported the configured retry ceiling as if two retries had run.

  `RunFailure` gains one optional, nullable object, `vendorFailure: { code, message, source }`: the vendor's code and words, read fail-soft from the rollout after the process exited, bound to the current turn, `null` on any doubt and for every harness without such a channel. The code is opaque evidence: nothing in Claudexor branches on its value, and it is not a member of `RunFailureCode`.

  The shared run loop records a typed terminal fact, `harness_reported_error`, only when the harness's own stdout frames produced an error event. A harness that voiced its own error and then exited non-zero is classified `unknown_harness_error` with an explicit `retryable: false` instead of `process_crash`; a signal kill, a spawn failure and a silent non-zero exit keep their labels. Retry, rotation, cooldown and credential condemnation read exactly the inputs they read before. `route.transient.exhausted` reports the observed retries beside the configured maximum.

  Invariants: none amended. INV-013, INV-046 and INV-049 hold (typed adapter evidence, no prose governance); INV-104's disclosed residual stays literally true, and the new field is additive evidence beside it. INV-020 and INV-022 hold: the schema field ships with its producer (the Codex adapter and the terminal writers) and its consumers (the failure record and the CLI inspect line). The app compatibility floor is unchanged.

## 3.12.9

### Patch Changes

- 125aea9: A Codex model list that omits a model no longer refuses a run that asks for it.

  The vendor CLI fetches its model list remotely and falls back to a bundled default list when that fetch times out, and nothing on the wire says which list answered. Claudexor treated the answer as account truth, so an explicit model the list lacked was refused before dispatch, in under a second, as an untyped failure. Observed live: `gpt-6-astra` was refused 32 times over two days on thirteen accounts that ran it successfully 262 times in the same window, and an empty answer refused the same way.

  A harness now declares what its live inventory proves. The new optional manifest capability `model_inventory_absence` defaults to `authoritative`, which is today's strict behaviour for every harness; Codex declares `advisory`, because its list can prove a model is present but never that one is absent. On an advisory source a missing (or empty) list stops being a refusal: the explicit model is forwarded to the vendor exactly as asked, the vendor accepts or refuses it, and the per-spawn gate discloses once, in the run's events, that the model was not listed. The same decision now serves the explicit reviewer panel, so an owner-chosen reviewer model is no longer refused by a stale list either.

  Nothing else moved. Manifest truth stays strict and is never substituted to admit a model, settings writes and the doctor's configured-model check still read the manifest and still refuse, automatic reviewer selection still skips an unlisted family at zero cost, authenticated account catalog operations still return a typed `model_unavailable`, pinned accounts still never rotate, and the probe cache and its TTL are unchanged.

  Three consequences are worth stating plainly. The explicit reviewer panel forwards an unlisted model without the run-event disclosure, because a reviewer spawn does not pass through the per-spawn gate. A vendor CLI that refuses a forwarded model reports it as an ordinary error carrying the vendor's own text, not as a typed model failure (only the HTTP model operations are typed, and those stay strict). And a mistyped model name on such a harness now costs one spawn at the vendor instead of failing for free at the gate.

  Invariants: INV-104 is amended with the owner's explicit approval of 2026-09-21 — strict wherever the truth source can prove absence, forward and disclose where it cannot, and never substitute one list for another. INV-105 follows from it: an explicit model can now reach a route its truth source could not vouch for, and the run discloses that instead of staying silent. INV-020 (schema first, regenerate, then consumers) and INV-022 (a field ships with its producer and consumer) hold: the capability is declared by the Codex manifest and read by the model gate and the reviewer panel in this change. The app compatibility floor is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- Add caller-owned Codex model operations through managed accounts shared with Agents, with exact model payloads, durable single-generation identity, result acknowledgement and typed outcome/cost evidence. Keep system prompts, conversation history and tool execution with the caller. Preserve unconfirmed setup termination during runtime replacement; a pre-permit failure without recorded process evidence remains unreconcilable and is disclosed rather than introducing a new journal format. Simplify contributor release review while retaining signed runtime manifests and exact candidate promotion.

- 2794ec7: Remove the engine-owned outer Seatbelt wrapper and restore each harness's
  native access policy. Delegated mutating runs now keep stable project identity
  separate from their disposable execution workspace, active requests use
  `readonly`, `workspace_write`, or explicitly trusted `full`, and historical
  outer-confinement artifacts remain readable without enabling new retired-mode
  runs.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Engine honesty fixes: a delivered plan now survives an unrecovered tool error
  instead of being escalated to a harness error before finalization, an empty
  thrown message can no longer terminalize a failed harness run as a clean
  success, and the automatic economy-ranking pass reads one pinned clock for all
  candidates instead of a fresh timestamp per comparison.

## 3.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 6e36993: Doctor and discover now explain WHY the codex CLI failed to resolve when the filesystem still holds evidence of an install: a dangling Homebrew symlink, a stripped exec bit, a directory shadowing the name, or a Caskroom/Cellar registration whose payload vanished — each with the exact `brew reinstall [--cask]` remediation. Diagnostic only: never gates a run, never executes a package manager. The codex doctor probes and diagnoses in the same scoped environment.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Claudexor 2.1.0: credential profiles (INV-135). Multiple subscriptions per
  harness with isolated vendor config dirs and namespaced secret slots; strict
  per-turn / thread-sticky selection with profile-isolated native-session
  resume; per-profile doctor probes and proactive per-profile subscription
  quota from the vendor oauth/usage endpoint; one typed profile policy per
  harness with provenance-recorded rotation on typed vendor-limit evidence
  only. Includes the unpublished 2.0.1 honest-engine and 2.0.2 simple-UI
  passes.

### Patch Changes

- 0fc050b: Credential profiles (INV-135): durable non-secret `credential_profiles`
  registry in the global config; the orchestrator resolves an explicit per-run
  profile id ONCE and stamps the typed profile on every HarnessRunSpec; adapters
  consume exactly the profile's transport (claude config-dir login / non-bare
  token / key; codex scoped CODEX_HOME / scoped auth.json; cursor, opencode,
  raw-api secret-ref keys) or refuse typed — never a fallback to default
  credentials. Namespaced secret slots (`claude_oauth:<profile>`), per-profile
  doctor probes (`GET /credential-profiles`, `claudexor profiles`), interactive
  `claudexor profiles login`, profile-stamped route evidence, and
  profile-isolated native-session resume.
